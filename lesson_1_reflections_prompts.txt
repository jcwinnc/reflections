Q:	What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A:	Pro: allows me to decide what to save when im ready.  Cons: Might allow to large of commits to be saved if not actively thinking about it.

A:	Some files are directly tied to another file and will require that other docs may need to be updated.
